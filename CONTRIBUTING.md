# Contributing to warnings-discord-bot

Your contributions mean the world to us! ðŸš€ We aim to keep the process transparent and straightforward, whether you're:

- [Reporting a bug](https://github.com/transcodeninja/warnings-discord-bot/issues).
- [Discussing the current code](https://github.com/transcodeninja/warnings-discord-bot/discussions).
- [Submitting a fix](https://github.com/transcodeninja/warnings-discord-bot/pulls).
- [Proposing new features](https://github.com/transcodeninja/warnings-discord-bot/issues).
- Thinking about becoming a maintainer.

## We Develop with Github

GitHub is our playgroundâ€”we use it to host code, track issues, and accept pull requests.

## Follow [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html) for a Seamless Experience

We stick to [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow), ensuring that all code changes happen through pull requests. Here's a simple guide:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. Add tests if your code introduces new functionalities.
3. If you tweak APIs, make sure to update the documentation.
4. Confirm that the test suite passes.
5. Ensure your code follows our style guidelines.
6. Build the node package using the `go build` command.
7. Issue that pull request!

## Craft Bug Reports with Detail and Love

Take a cue from these [examples](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) for crafting top-notch bug reports. Great bug reports have:

- A quick summary and background.
- Clear steps to reproduce, including sample code if possible.
- Your expectations vs. reality.
- Any notes, experiments, or thoughts on the issue.

Thorough bug reports warm our hearts. Seriously!

## Embrace a Consistent Coding Style

Our Golang code follows the [gofmt](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/gofmt) formatter. Easily maintain the style with the [golang.Go](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=golang.Go) VS Code extension.
